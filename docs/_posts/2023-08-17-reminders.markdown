Eight years ago, I told myself, I would start a blog. Well, today's the day.

Below is a [perpetual stew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_stew) of what I'm thinking about.

## On self
* Embrace change - seriously.
* Be kind, but have a backbone.
* Be present.
* Always have a sense of humor.
* Tell stories.
* Be human.
* Don't stagnate. Break routines. Add novelty.
* Grow.
* Prove you can do hard things to build confidence in yourself. Repeat.
* [Conventional wisdom](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) doesn't always apply to yourself at all points in your lifetime.
* Make change.

## On people
* Choosing the right people matters more than picking the "all-stars." Team synergy is key.
* People remember how you make them feel.
* Opinions differentiate the experienced from inexperienced.

## On getting stuff done
* Lack of clarity stops progress.
* Schedule.
* Time box.

## On software engineering
* Design systems with adaptability as a core principle.
* Iterate quickly and minimize feedback turnaround time.
* Don't wait until it's "done" to reveal your work.
* Everything has trade offs.
* "Least worst architecture" may make more sense than "best".

## Quotes
> I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to liveâ€”the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious. - [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)

### Change log
* 2023-09-10 - Edit lists and group into categories.
* 2024-03-17 - List adjustments - separate self and software engineering list. Edit points for conciseness.
