On self
* Embrace change - seriously.
* Be kind, but have boundaries.
* Be present.
* Always have a sense of humor.
* Tell stories.
* Be human.
* Don't stagnate. Break routines. Add novelty.
* Grow. Everyday.
* Prove you can do hard things to build confidence in yourself. Repeat.
* [Conventional wisdom](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) doesn't always apply to yourself at all points in your lifetime.
* Make change. It can be as small as complimenting a stranger or saying thank you to a friend.
* You always have a choice.

On people
* Choosing the right people matters more than picking the "all-stars." Team synergy is key.
* People remember how you make them feel.
* Opinions differentiate the experienced from inexperienced.

On getting stuff done
* Lack of clarity stops progress.
* Schedule.
* Time box.
* Procrastination can be used to your advantage.

On software engineering
* Design systems with adaptability as a core principle.
* Iterate quickly and minimize feedback turnaround time.
* Don't wait until it's "done" to reveal your work.
* Everything has trade offs.
* "Least worst architecture" may make more sense than "best."

> A bad goal makes you say, “I want to do that someday.” A great goal makes you take action immediately. - [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/goals)
