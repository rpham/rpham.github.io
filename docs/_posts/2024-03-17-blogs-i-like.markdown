List of blogs that...

Have impacted my thinking
* [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) - Insightful, succinct writing.
* [Pointer.io](https://www.pointer.io/archives/) - I'm subscribed to their newsletter.


I would like to spend more time on
* [Webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) - I haven't looked at many of these, but it's fun to peruse occasionally.
* [Ham Vocke](https://hamvocke.com/blog/time-to-get-personal/) - Linking a post I liked as a reminder of why I should read this blog more.
