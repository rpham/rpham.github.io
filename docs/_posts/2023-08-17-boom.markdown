Eight years ago, I told myself, I would start a blog. Well, today's the day.

Here are some insights from self-reflection during that time:

On principles:
* Embrace change. 
    * Corollary: design systems with adaptability as a core principle.
    * Corollary: Iterate quickly and minimize feedback turnaround time. Don't wait until it's "done" to reveal your work.
* Be nice, but have a backbone.
* Don't underestimate the power of humor and storytelling.
* Be present.
* Throw in novelty.
* Be 1% better every day.
* Make change.

On people:
* Choosing the right people matters more than picking the "all-stars." Team synergy is key.
* People remember how you make them feel.
* Opinions differentiate the experienced from inexperienced.

Change log:
* 2023-09-10 - Edit lists and group into categories.
