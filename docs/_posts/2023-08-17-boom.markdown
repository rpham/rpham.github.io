Eight years ago, I told myself, I would start a blog. Well, today's the day.

Here are some insights from self-reflection during that time:
* Choosing the right people matters more than picking the most experienced. Team synergy is key.
* Embrace change, and design systems with adaptability as a core principle.
* Be nice, but have a backbone.
* Opinions differentiate the experienced from inexperienced.
* People remember how you make them feel.
* Iterate quickly. Find and listen to feedback. Don't wait until it's "done" to reveal your work.
* Value humor and storytelling.
* Be present.
* Throw in novelty.
